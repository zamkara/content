## Abstract

Alright I would not type a long bunch of text explaining what impostor syndrome is so lemme just
straight copy it from Wikipedia and put here.

Impostor syndrome, also known as impostor phenomenon or impostorism, is a psychological experience of intellectual and professional infraudulence. It is "the subjective experience of perceived self-doubt in one's abilities and accomplishments compared with others, despite evidence to suggest the contrary."

Those who have it may doubt their skills, talents, or accomplishments. They may have a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as frauds. Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon do not believe they deserve their success or luck. They may think that they are deceiving others because they feel as if they are not as intelligent as they outwardly portray themselves to be.

Impostor syndrome is not a recognized psychiatric disorder and is not featured in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual nor is it listed as a diagnosis in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Thus, clinicians lack information on the prevalence, comorbidities, and best practices for assessing and treating impostor syndrome. However, outside the academic literature, impostor syndrome has become widely discussed, especially in the context of achievement in the workplace.

## Types of Impostor Syndrome

According to [this person](https://impostorsyndrome.com/valerie-young/) (she looks like she knows what she's talking about), there are five types of impostor syndrome:

1. **The Perfectionist**: They set excessively high goals for themselves and when they fail to reach a goal, they experience major self-doubt and worry about measuring up.
2. **The Super-person**: They push themselves to work harder than those around them to prove that they are not impostors. They feel the need to succeed in all aspects of life.
3. **The Natural Genius**: They judge their competence based on ease and speed as opposed to their efforts. They believe that if they have to work hard at something, they must be bad at it.
4. **The Soloist**: They feel as though asking for help reveals their phoniness. They believe that they must accomplish tasks on their own, and if they need to ask for help, it is a sign of failure.
5. **The Expert**: They measure their competence based on what and how much they know or can do. They fear being exposed as inexperienced or unknowledgeable.

## Personal Experience

At some point in life, I might have been subjected to couple traits of the types of impostor syndrome mentioned above.
It probably depends on the situation I'm in during that time. So far, the most likely one I've experienced is the
soloist type. I always feel like I have to do everything on my own and asking for help is a sign of weakness. Tho, it's
all in the past now. I realized I had done so much better than I thought I did.
I'm just a human, after all. I'm not perfect. I make mistakes. I learn from them. I move on. That's how life is.

Alas, let's continue to the next section.

## Dealing With It

Let's just get straight to the point. Here are some ways to deal with impostor syndrome:

1. **Acknowledge it**: The first step to overcoming impostor syndrome is to acknowledge that you have it. Once you recognize that you are experiencing impostor syndrome, you can begin to take steps to address it.
2. **Talk about it**: Sharing your feelings of self-doubt with others can help you to realize that you are not alone. Talking to friends, family, or a therapist can help you to gain perspective on your feelings and maybe start being more honest with yourself.
3. **Do a reality check**: When you start to doubt your abilities, take a moment to reflect on your accomplishments. Remind yourself of your past successes and the skills that you have developed over time.
4. **Challenge self-doubt**: Ask yourself if there is any real evidence to support your feelings of inadequacy. Try to replace negative thoughts with something more pragmatic, practical, and realistic.
5. **Stop comparing yourself to others**: Remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own progress and growth. You're not their clone, you're you.
6. **Set realistic goals**: Instead of setting unrealistic goals for yourself, try to set more achievable ones. Break down larger goals into smaller tasks and celebrate your successes along the way.
7. **Keep on learning**: By continuing to learn and grow, you can build your confidence and skills. Take on new challenges and seek out opportunities for growth and development for your own sake.
