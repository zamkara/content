## Abstract

It's been a while since I first started using Linux. Was it 2020? 2019? Can't remember anymore, to be honest. Unironically, I didn't start with Ubuntu as my first distro. I started with Manjaro and then moved to Arch. I loved the AUR and the rolling release model. But then, the community and the elitism started to get to me. People were gatekeeping left and right, many of them were toxic, and the community was just... not welcoming. I felt like I was in a cult, and I didn't like it. I didn't move to Ubuntu, to be frank, and I have no plans to do so. But then, I'm quite concerned about newcomers on Linux.

See, when people start out on Linux, word on the street is that "muh Kali Linux bro, muh Arch Linux bro, very cool bro" happens a lot. And then, they get into the community and they get shunned. Tho the Kali Linux part is understandable. But the Arch Linux part? Not so much. I mean, I get it. Arch is cool. It's a great distro. But it's not for everyone. And it's not the best distro for newcomers. It's like giving a Ferrari to a 16-year-old who just got their driver's license. It's not a good idea.

And then again, the elitism. The gatekeeping. The toxicity. It's not good, healthy, or welcoming.

## Meet Ubuntu

There is a solution to this, and it's called Ubuntu. I have to admit, I was one of those people who badmouthed Ubuntu. I called it "noobuntu", "bloatware", "Windows for Linux", "Canonical's milking product", and many more. But then, I realized that Ubuntu is actually a great distro for newcomers and people who just want to get things done. Very user-friendly down from the first time you boot it in live environment, to the installation process, and then to the end part, where you actually use it.

Pipe down, Arch users, cause I know you're reading this. I know you can customize your Arch to be as user-friendly as Ubuntu. But that's not the point. The point is, Ubuntu is already user-friendly out of the box. You don't have to do anything. Just install it, and you're good to go. You can install your favorite apps, customize it to your liking, and you're done. No need to spend hours configuring your system. No need to spend hours troubleshooting. No need to spend hours reading the Arch Wiki. It just works.

"But bro, snap bad, bro. Canonical bad, bro. Ubuntu bad, bro." I know, I know. Canonical is not the best company out there. They have their flaws. But then again, who doesn't? And snaps? They're just... there. You can use them, you can not use them, or you can just outright remove them. It's up to you. You can use Flatpak, AppImage, native packages, or even compile from source. It's your choice. You have the freedom to choose.

"Update slow, bro. AppArmor bad, bro." The point of Ubuntu is stability. Said distro doesn't need to be rolling. Hell, it doesn't even need to be bleeding edge. It just needs to work. And Ubuntu does that. Didn't really have any problems with it, generally. For the AppArmor part, I haven't researched it yet. Tho what I heard and read is that it's a security feature. I mean what are the chances noobs like them will even know what AppArmor is, let alone care. They just want to use their computer, not tinker with it.

## A Little Tip

So, if you're new to Linux or just curious about it, give Ubuntu a try. It's a great distro. And if you don't like it, you can always switch to another distro. There are hundreds of them out there. You just have to find the one that suits you.

Don't follow the crowd. Don't listen to the elitists. Don't get discouraged by the toxicity. Just do you. It's your computer, your choice. Make the best of it. And remember, it's just an operating system. An operating system is just another tool down the shed. You're supposed to be the one being productive, not rice your tool to be "productive". A cult following is not needed either. Just use what you like and be happy with it. That's all that matters.

## Epilogue

Well, I would still use Arch regardless of my stance on Ubuntu. I'm not a newcomer, as far as I concerned. There's alot of things in Arch that I like and I can't find in Ubuntu. Being on the edge is pretty much my thing, and Arch Build System and AUR is just too good to pass for me.

Alas, for newcomers, please use Ubuntu.
