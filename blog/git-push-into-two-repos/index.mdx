## Abstract

So I just hosted [my own Gitea instance](https://git.irvanma.eu.org) a few while back. It's pretty cool and I'm very happy with how it goes. It has so many things
that I can do with it, well, speaking of features, it allows me to do everything GitHub can do, but more. One feature that I like in particular is the ability to
mirror repository from other Git hosting services. This is very useful for me as I can have a backup of my repositories in case something bad happens to GitHub.

GitHub in general also has something similar to the mirroring feature called GitHub Imports, except that it's technically **not** a mirroring feature. It merely
cloned the repository from my Gitea instance into my GitHub account and... that's it really. So I thought for a bit, "What if I can push my code into both GitHub
and Gitea at the same time?" And so I did some research and found out that it's actually possible to do so. Here's how you can do it.

## Pushing into Two Repositories

At first, I devised a plan that involves writing out a script that will push the code into both repositories by switching the remote URL back and forth. I actually
discussed this a bit with my fellow [GNU/Weeb](https://gnuweeb.org) peers while also asking how did Linus Torvalds mirror `linux` repository from lore to GitHub.
They told me that Linus uses a script to push the code into both repositories at once. So I explored the idea by writing a script that does just that.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

git push
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:irvanmalik48/laterano.git
git push
git remote set-url origin git@git.irvanma.eu.org:irvanmalik48/laterano.git

echo "Pushed into both repositories."
```

I saved the script as `push.sh` and made it executable by running `chmod +x push.sh`. I then ran the script by executing `./push.sh` and voila! The code is now
pushed into both repositories. Pretty nice, right? But then, I googled a bit and found out that there's a better way to do this.

## Using Multiple Remote Push URLs

Turns out, you can actually set multiple push URLs for a single repository. This is very useful as you don't have to switch the remote URL back and forth. I got the idea
from [this blog post](https://bacardi55.io/2024/02/21/git-tips-push-to-multiple-git-repo-in-one-command/) (which is an inspiration for this post anyways, kudos to whoever
wrote that post). Here's how you can do it.

```bash
git remote set-url --add --push origin git@git.irvanma.eu.org:irvanmalik48/laterano.git
git remote set-url --add --push origin git@github.com:irvanmalik48/laterano.git
```

And that's it! You can now push your code into both repositories by running `git push`. If you're still not convinced, you can check the remote URL by running
`git remote -v` and see that there are two push URLs for the `origin` remote. For me, it looks like this:

```bash
lappland âžœ ~/Projects/laterano (main) $ git remote -v
origin	git@git.irvanma.eu.org:irvanmalik48/laterano (fetch)
origin	git@git.irvanma.eu.org:irvanmalik48/laterano (push)
origin	git@github.com:irvanmalik48/laterano (push)
```

## Conclusion

So that's how you can push your code into two repositories at once. I hope you find this post useful and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to
