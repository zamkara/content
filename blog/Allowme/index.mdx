# AllowMe

AllowMe is a fork of the Tccplus project created by [jslegendre](https://github.com/jslegendre). It is a software tool that allows you to grant or remove accessibility permissions for any application on your system.

## Installation

You can install AllowMe by downloading it from the release page in the Tccplus repository. Here are the steps:

1. Open the [AllowMe release page](https://github.com/jslegendre/tccplus/releases) in the Tccplus repository.
2. Choose the latest version of AllowMe that is compatible with your operating system.
3. Download the AllowMe file to your computer.

### Usage
<a 
    href="https://github.com/zamkara/Allowme"
    target="blank"><img
    src="https://github.com/zamkara/Allowme/blob/main/assets/usage.gif?raw=true"
    alt="Preview"
    className="rounded-lg my-1 w-full"
    onContextMenu="return false"
    draggable="false"
    />
    </a>

Once you have downloaded AllowMe, you can use it in the following ways:

**Method 1: Running AllowMe from the file location**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the AllowMe file.
3. Give executable permission to AllowMe using the command `chmod +x allowme`.
4. Run AllowMe using the command `./allowme path_application`, where `path_application` is the file path of the application you want to grant or remove accessibility permissions for.

**Method 2: Copying AllowMe to the execution folder**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the AllowMe file is located.
3. Copy the AllowMe file to the execution folder such as `/usr/local/bin/` using the command `sudo cp allowme /usr/local/bin/`.
4. Give executable permission to AllowMe using the command `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/allowme`.
5. Now you can use AllowMe with the command `allowme path_application`, where `path_application` is the file path of the application you want to grant or remove accessibility permissions for.

Make sure you have administrative privileges (sudo) to install and run AllowMe properly.
